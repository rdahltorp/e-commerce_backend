# E-Commerce Backend

## Description

The E-Commerce backend application helps users manage an online store by allowing users to manupulate a databes to add, update, delete, and pull the inventory for their store. Using express routes, users can submit specific HTTP requests that will directly manipulate and store the data in their database. 

This project gave me better insight on how Sequelize can work with and manipulate a database withought having to write specific SQL code. 


## Installation

To utalize this application or to work on the code, clone this repo down to the your local machine. Once opened in your favorite code editor, be sure to "npm i" in the terminal so all the necissary packages are installed. Once installed, run the schema.sql file in MySQL and launch the app by running "npm start". 

To test the routes I used Insomnia, but feel free to use Postman or any other REST client. 

## Usage
